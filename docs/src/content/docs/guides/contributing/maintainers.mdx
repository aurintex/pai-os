description: Roles in the paiOS project and how to become a maintainer
---

paiOS is a community-driven project. We have different levels of involvement based on contribution history and trust.

## Project Roles

### Contributor
Anyone who submits code, opens an issue, or participates in discussions. All contributors are expected to follow our [Development Standards](../standards/).

### Maintainer
Individuals with write access to the repository. Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
- Triaging issues and helping contributors.
- Managing releases and guiding the project's technical direction.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Becoming a maintainer is **earned** through regular contributions and building trust with the existing team. We look for:

1.  **Consistency**: Regularly submitting high-quality PRs over a period of several months.
2.  **Review Quality**: Helping others by reviewing their PRs and providing constructive feedback.
3.  **Community Help**: Assisting others in discussions, issues, or community channels.
4.  **Ownership**: Taking responsibility for a specific area of the codebase or documentation.

### Selection Process

There is no formal application process. Existing maintainers regularly look for active and helpful contributors. When someone consistently demonstrates the qualities above, they are invited to join the maintainer team.

# Cursor Rules Management & SSoT Enforcement

## Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
The **official documentation** located in the `docs/` folder is the absolute **Single Source of Truth** for this project. This includes coding standards, architecture, workflows, and the Definition of Done (DoD).

## Principles for Rule Creation
To prevent redundancy and maintain consistency, follow these principles when creating or updating `.mdc` files:

1.  **NO REDUNDANCY**: Never duplicate information that is already defined in `docs/`. 
2.  **REFERRE NOT DEFINE**: Cursor rules should act as "technical enforcers" or "pointers" to the documentation. Instead of listing rules, provide links to the relevant `.mdx` files in `docs/`.
3.  **CHECK FIRST**: Before creating a new `.mdc` file, search the `docs/` folder to see if the topic is already covered. If it is, the rule should simply enforce those existing standards.
4.  **REDUCE & CONSOLIDATE**: Prefer fewer, high-quality rules that point to comprehensive documentation over many small, fragmented rules.
5.  **CROSS-REFERENCE**: Always include a `References` section at the end of a rule pointing to the SSoT in `docs/`.

## Rule Maintenance Triggers
- **New Code Pattern**: If a new pattern emerges in 3+ files, document it in `docs/` first, then create/update a rule to enforce it.
- **Outdated Rules**: If a rule contradicts the current documentation in `docs/`, update the rule immediately to point to the correct documentation.

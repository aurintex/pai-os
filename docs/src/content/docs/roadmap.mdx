## 🗺️ Roadmap

> **⚠️ Temporary Roadmap:** This is currently a **minimalist, temporary roadmap**. A detailed roadmap is in development and will be created in parallel with the architecture documentation, where there will be overlapping content and cross-references.
>
> This roadmap is a living document and subject to change as the project evolves.

## Phase 0: Foundation (Current)
*Focus: Project Setup, High-Quality Groundwork, and Architecture Definitions.*

- [x] **Monorepo Setup:** Establish structure for `engine`, `os`, and `apps`.
- [x] **Architecture Definitions:** Define Clean Architecture layers and IPC (gRPC/UDS).
- [x] **Infrastructure:** Set up CI/CD, License Compliance via `cargo-deny`, and DCO bots.
- [x] **Documentation:** Launch Starlight documentation site.

## Phase 1: The Accelerator (USB Form Factor)
*Focus: Delivering the first tangible hardware product in two variants.*

### Developer Edition (Community)
- **Hardware:** Radxa Rock 5C Support.
- **Software:** Basic `paiOS` image with standard NPU inference.
- **Goal:** Enable the community to build and hack their own AI accelerators.

### Professional Edition
- **Hardware:** Custom Aluminum Case, Pre-flashed trusted firmware.
- **Software:** Tuned "Pro" image, Out-of-the-box experience (Plug & Play).
- **Features:**
    - Real-time Whisper STT pipeline.
    - Basic API integrations (HID injection).

## Phase 2: The Companion (Wearable Form Factor)
*Focus: Evolution into a standalone, context-aware wearable.*

- [ ] **Hardware:** Custom PCB, Battery, Camera integration.
- [ ] **Engine:** Multimodal Pipeline (Vision-Language-Action).
- [ ] **Ecosystem:** Sync capabilities and "Memory" interface.
- [ ] **Goal:** A standalone "Second Brain" that physically travels with you.

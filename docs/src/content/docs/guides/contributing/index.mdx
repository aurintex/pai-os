Thank you for your interest in **paiOS**! We are building a local-first AI ecosystem, and we need your help to make it a reality.

## Who can contribute?

Everyone! Whether you are a **Senior Developer** or a **Junior** starting your journey, your help is valued.

We value quality and simplicity. You are welcome to use **AI tools** (like Cursor or Copilot), provided the final code follows our [standards](./standards/). Most importantly: have fun!

### What we are looking for

-   **AI & ML Enthusiasts**: Help us run models (VLMs, audio) on local hardware.
-   **Rust Developers**: Our core engine is Rust. We need experts and learners alike.
-   **OS Builders**: Improve our Debian-based OS and build recipes.
-   **Designers**: Help with hardware design, icons, and UI/UX.
-   **Testers & Architects**: Help us find bugs or design a better system.
-   **Generalists**: If you like working across the whole stack, you're in the right place.

**Don't see your role listed?** Reach out anyway! Every contribution counts.

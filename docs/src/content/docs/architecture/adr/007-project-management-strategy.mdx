title: "ADR-007: Project Management Strategy"
description: Adoption of GitHub Projects for task tracking and roadmap visibility
---

## Status

**Accepted** (2025-03-01)

## Context

To scale paiOS effectively, we need a project management system that supports:

1. **Open Source Transparency**: Contributors must see the roadmap and task state without paid seats (e.g. Jira/Linear).
2. **Integration with Code**: AI agents and tooling inside the repo should be able to read issues and PRs via CLI/API so tasks and code stay in one place.

## Decision

We adopt **GitHub Projects V2** as the sole source of truth for task tracking.

### Structure

- **Single board** with Kanban-style views (e.g. Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Review, Done).
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions move issues based on PR status where appropriate.

### Why Not Linear or Jira?

- **Visibility**: External contributors cannot see Linear/Jira boards without an invite or paid account. GitHub Projects is visible with the repo.
- **Context**: AI agents and scripts inside the repo can read Issue/PR descriptions via GitHub CLI or API more easily than external SaaS tools.

## Rationale

Benchmarking against high-velocity OSS projects (e.g. VS Code, Supabase) shows that keeping code and tasks in the same place reduces friction. GitHub's GraphQL API allows custom agents (e.g. task-master) to "read the board" and stay in sync with human contributors.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Zero cost**: No per-seat pricing for contributors; anyone with repo access sees the project.
- **Single place**: Issues, PRs, and project board live in GitHub.

### Negative

- **Feature gap**: GitHub Projects lacks some advanced features of Linear (e.g. cycles, velocity tracking). We accept this trade-off for transparency and simplicity.

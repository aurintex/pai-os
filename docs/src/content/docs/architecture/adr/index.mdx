description: Log of architectural decisions with context and rationale

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made throughout the project. Each ADR captures:

- The context and problem statement
- The decision made
- The rationale behind the decision
- Consequences and trade-offs

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that captures a significant architectural decision, along with its context and consequences. ADRs help maintain a record of why certain architectural choices were made, making it easier for future developers to understand the reasoning behind the system design.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use the following template:

```markdown

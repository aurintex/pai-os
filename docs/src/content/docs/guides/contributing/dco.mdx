title: Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
description: Why and how we use DCO for license compliance
---

paiOS uses the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** to ensure that all contributions are properly licensed.

## Why DCO?

Instead of a complex legal agreement (CLA), we use the DCO because:
- **It is easy**: No legal review or paperwork is needed.
- **It is a standard**: Used by major projects like the **Linux kernel** and **Git**.
- **Transparency**: It maintains clear ownership while keeping the contribution process fast.

## How to Sign Off

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message. By adding this line, you certify that you have the right to submit the work under the project's license.

### Format
```text frame="none"
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Methods

#### 1. Auto-sign (Recommended)
Configure Git to automatically add your sign-off for this repository:
```bash frame="none"
git config format.signoff true
```

#### 2. Using `git commit -s`
The `-s` flag automatically adds the sign-off line:
```bash frame="none"
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

#### 3. Manual Sign-off
You can also manually add the line to your commit message (e.g., in a multi-line message).

## DCO Enforcement

- **DCO Bot**: Automatically checks all Pull Requests for DCO sign-off.
- **No Exceptions**: All commits, including documentation-only changes, require a sign-off. If a PR has unsigned commits, they must be amended before it can be merged.

---

This glossary defines abbreviations, acronyms, and technical terms used throughout the paiOS documentation. Terms are listed alphabetically. Where a term has dedicated architecture or reference docs, the entry includes a **See also** line linking to those pages for implementation details.

## A

**AEC**: Acoustic Echo Cancellation. Hardware-efficient loopback cancellation that prevents microphone feedback when the device is speaking (TTS). Critical for voice assistants to avoid false wake word triggers. See also [Audio domain](/architecture/modules/audio/) (AEC feature and pipeline).

**AI device**: Product-neutral term for hardware running paiOS and paiEngine (the engine). The documentation uses "AI device" (or simply "device") in architecture and API docs because the platform powers multiple form factors (e.g. paiBox (Private AI Server), paiScribe (Meeting Device), and future products), and the same concepts (MCP Server/Client, HITL, adapters) apply to all. "Wearable" is used only when the form factor is specifically relevant (e.g. screen-less confirmation, mobile UI). See also [ADR-004: Engine Architecture](/architecture/adr/004-system-architecture/) (context and form factors).

**ADR**: Architecture Decision Record. Documents architectural decisions and their rationale. See [ADR Index](/architecture/adr/).

**API**: Application Programming Interface. A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. See also [API Reference](/reference/) (overview of all APIs), [API domain](/architecture/modules/api/) (gateway design), and [gRPC API Reference](/reference/api/) (service definitions).

## C

## D

**DDD**: Domain-Driven Design. Software development approach focusing on domain logic and business rules.

**Domain crate**: A Cargo crate that implements one engine domain (e.g. `vision`, `audio`). Each domain crate follows Hexagonal Architecture with Rust modules `domain/`, `ports/`, and `adapters/`. See [Engine Domains](/architecture/modules/) (overview and list).

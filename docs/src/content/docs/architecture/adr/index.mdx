title: Architecture Decision Records
description: Log of architectural decisions with context and rationale
---

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made throughout the project. Each ADR captures:

- The context and problem statement
- The decision made
- The rationale behind the decision
- Consequences and trade-offs

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that captures a significant architectural decision, along with its context and consequences. ADRs help maintain a record of why certain architectural choices were made, making it easier for future developers to understand the reasoning behind the system design.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use the following template:

```markdown
---
title: ADR-XXX: [Short Title]
description: [Brief description]
---

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the issue motivating this decision]

## Decision

[Describe the change that you're proposing or have made]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change]
```

## Current ADRs

**Reading order (narrative thread):** Foundation (001–003) → Engine pattern (004) → Engine implementation in Rust (008) → Domain and tooling (005, 006) → Project and AI workflow (007, 009).

paiOS requires contributors to sign a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** before their first contribution can be merged.

## Why CLA?

We use a CLA instead of a simple sign-off (DCO) because:

- **Long-term sustainability** – Grants aurintex the flexibility for future business models
- **Legal clarity** – Clear ownership rights while you retain copyright
- **One-time process** – Sign once, contribute forever

<Aside type="tip">
The CLA is managed via **CLAassistant** – a simple GitHub integration. You only need to sign once, and it takes less than a minute.
</Aside>

## What You Agree To

By signing the CLA, you grant aurintex the right to:

1. **Use your contribution** under the project's license (AGPL-3.0 or Apache-2.0)
2. **Relicense** the contribution if needed for project sustainability
3. **Defend** the project's trademarks

**You retain full copyright** to your contributions. The CLA is not a copyright transfer.

## How to Sign

1. **Create a Pull Request** – The CLAassistant bot will automatically comment
2. **Click the link** – You'll be redirected to sign via GitHub OAuth
3. **Sign once** – All future PRs are automatically approved

Example bot comment:
"Thank you for your contribution! Please sign our CLA at [link]"
```

<Aside type="note">
If you're contributing on behalf of your employer, make sure you have permission to sign the CLA on their behalf, or have them sign the Corporate CLA.
</Aside>

## For Corporate Contributors

If you're contributing as part of your job, your employer may need to sign a **Corporate CLA**. Contact [info@aurintex.com](mailto:info@aurintex.com) for the corporate agreement.

# GitHub Issues and Branch Naming

- **Before creating a GitHub issue** (via MCP, CLI, or when drafting content for the user): Use **Conventional Commits** format for the issue title. Read the "Conventional Commits (Issue and PR Titles)" and "Create a Branch" sections in the Workflow doc for the exact format, types (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.), and branch naming (including optional issue number).
- **Do not duplicate** the convention here; the SSoT is the Workflow doc.

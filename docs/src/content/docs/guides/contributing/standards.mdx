To keep paiOS maintainable and high-quality, we follow a set of core principles and standards. Whether you are using AI tools or writing code manually, these rules apply.

## Core Principles

We value code that is easy to read, test, and maintain. These principles serve as a **compass**, not a set of rigid laws.

-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering. Always choose the simplest solution.
-   **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**: We focus on the 20% of effort that provides 80% of the value.
-   **Pragmatic Utility**: We prioritize actual usefulness over code perfection. Ask: "Does this actually help the user?"
-   **SOLID**: Ensure designs are flexible and robust.
-   **Clean Code**: Write code for humans first. Use descriptive names and small functions.
-   **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear boundaries between layers (Engine, HAL, RPC). See [Architecture Documentation](/architecture/).

## Code Style

### General Rules
- Follow the rules defined in `.cursorrules`.
- Every commit MUST be signed off (`git commit -s`). See [DCO Guide](/guides/contributing/dco/).

### Rust Style
- Use `rustfmt` and `clippy` (zero warnings target).
- Documentation comments (`///` or `//!`) are required for all public and significant internal items.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

All changes must meet these requirements before they can be merged:

### 1. Correctness & Quality
- Code builds without errors (`cargo build`).
- All tests pass (`cargo test`).
- No clippy warnings.
- Solution follows KISS and Clean Architecture principles.

### 2. Documentation
-   **User/Integration**: New features or API changes are documented in Starlight.
-   **Internal**: Complex logic is explained via Rust doc comments.
-   **Sync**: Documentation is regenerated and verified via `npm run build` in the `docs/` folder.
- See the [Documentation Guide](/guides/contributing/documentation/) for details.

### 3. Compliance
- DCO sign-off is present.
- Dependencies are license-compliant (`cargo deny`).
- No sensitive data committed.

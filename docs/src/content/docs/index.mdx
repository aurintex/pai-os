description: The open-source, local-first operating system for the PAI ecosystem
---

**paiOS** is the open-source, local-first operating system powering the **PAI (Personal AI)** ecosystem. It provides the software stack (Engine + OS) that enables PAI hardware products to process voice, vision, context, and intelligence directly on trusted hardware, giving you full control over your data. Visit [aurintex.com](https://www.aurintex.com) for more information on the PAI vision.

## The Vision

PAI creates a bridge between powerful local hardware and your daily digital life. Our mission is to democratize access to hardware-accelerated AI while guaranteeing data sovereignty.

### 1. The PAI Accelerator (Current Focus)
The project starts with a **USB AI Accelerator** based on the [Radxa Rock 5C](https://radxa.com/products/rock5/5c/) SBC. This device connects to your PC and acts as a dedicated AI server.
*   **Local Inference:** Runs sLLMs, STT (Speech-to-Text), embeddings, and other specialized AI models entirely offline.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Acts as a Linux USB gadget, compatible with any host OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **API-First:** Exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints (similar to Ollama) for integration with tools like Obsidian, LibreOffice, or VS Code.
*   **Intelligent Input & Control:** Acts as a virtual keyboard/mouse (HID) to "type" text or execute commands directly into your PC, enabling seamless AI-driven interaction.

### 2. The PAI Wearable (Future)
The long-term vision is to shrink this technology into a standalone **AI Wearable**. By building a robust OS and Engine today on the Accelerator, we lay the foundation for a future device that captures context and assists you throughout your day - completely privately.

## Technology Stack

paiOS is built for performance, security, and reproducibility.

*   **Core Engine:** Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for memory safety and low-latency hardware abstraction (HAL).
*   **Operating System:** Minimal, embedded Linux (Debian-based) built with [Debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos) for reproducibility.
*   **Hardware:** Optimized for NPU-based SBCs (Single Board Computers), starting with the Radxa ecosystem.

## Repository Structure

This monorepo contains the entire **paiOS** software stack:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`engine/`** | The **paiOS Engine**. The Rust-based neural orchestrator, handling HAL, Security, and IPC. |
| **`os/`** | **paiOS** build configurations. Reproducible embedded Linux images. |
| **`apps/`** | Modular extensions and reference implementations for the PAI ecosystem. |
| **`docs/`** | This documentation site (built with Starlight). |

## Current Status

🚧 **Phase 0: Foundation & Architecture**

We are currently executing the **"Great Pivot"**: Transitioning from internal Proof-of-Concept to this clean, production-ready open-source architecture.

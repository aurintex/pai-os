description: Core principles, code style, and the Definition of Done for paiOS
---

To keep paiOS maintainable and high-quality, we follow a set of core principles and standards. Whether you are using AI tools or writing code manually, these rules apply.

## Core Principles

We value code that is easy to read, test, and maintain. These principles serve as a **compass**, not a set of rigid laws. Use your common sense and prioritize what makes the most sense for the project's health and user value.

-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering. Always choose the simplest solution that solves the problem. Simple code is easier to debug and more resilient.
-   **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**: We focus on the 20% of effort that provides 80% of the value. Avoid spending too much time on minor details that don't impact the user experience or system stability.
-   **Pragmatic Utility**: Even the most perfect code is worthless if it provides no value to the user. Always ask yourself: "Does this change actually help the user?" We prioritize actual usefulness over code perfection.
-   **Critical Thinking**: Don't just follow a task list. Challenge assumptions and ask if a feature is necessary. The success of a project is rarely decided by the code itself, but by how useful it is to people.
-   **SOLID**: We apply SOLID principles to ensure our designs are flexible and robust.
-   **Clean Code**: Write code for humans first. Use descriptive names, small functions, and clear logic.
-   **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear boundaries between different parts of the system. See our [Architecture Documentation](/architecture/) for details.

## Code Style

Consistency helps everyone understand the codebase faster.

### General Rules
- Follow the rules defined in `.cursorrules`. These are designed to help both humans and AI assistants follow our project standards.
- If you use **AI tools** (like Cursor or Copilot), always review the generated code to ensure it follows the principles above.
- **DCO Sign-off**: Every commit MUST be signed off (`git commit -s`).

### Rust Style
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting.
- Run `clippy` for linting. We aim for zero clippy warnings.
- Documentation comments (`///`) are required for all public items.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

All changes must meet these requirements before they can be merged:

### Compiles & Tests Pass
- Code builds without errors (`cargo build`).
- All tests pass (`cargo test`).
- No warnings (unless there is a documented exception).
- **CI/CD**: All GitHub Actions checks must pass.

### Quality & Review
- At least one maintainer has approved the PR.
- All review comments are addressed.
- Code follows the core principles (KISS, SOLID, etc.).

### Documentation
-   **User-facing changes**: Update relevant Starlight guides in the `docs/` folder.
-   **Internal changes**: Ensure the code is self-documenting or include Rust doc comments (`///`).
-   **README**: Update if the high-level project description or quick-start changes.

### Compliance
- Every commit has a DCO sign-off.
- All dependencies are compatible with AGPL-3.0 (checked via `cargo deny`).
- No secret keys or sensitive data are committed.

## Documentation Layers

Documentation in paiOS follows the **C4 model** philosophy to ensure both high-level clarity and low-level precision.

### High-Level (Starlight Docs)
This documentation site (Starlight) is for **Context (System)** and **Container (Service)** levels.
- **Goal**: Provide a "big picture" overview for users and developers.
- **Content**: Architecture diagrams, guides, technical specifications, and the "why" behind decisions.
- **Location**: All files in the `docs/` folder.

### Low-Level (In-Code Documentation)
Technical details at the **Component** and **Code** levels belong in the source code.
- **Goal**: Document the implementation details, API usage, and internal logic for developers.
- **Content**: Rust doc comments (`///`), module-level documentation, and clear code comments for complex logic.
- **Location**: Directly inside `.rs` files. These are automatically extracted via `cargo doc`.

## Documentation Updates

Documentation is a first-class citizen in paiOS. Any change that affects how the system works, how it is built, or how users interact with it **must** include updates to the relevant documentation.

- **Stay Relevant**: If you change a feature, update its corresponding guide or reference page.
- **Explain "Why"**: Use the documentation to explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions.
- **Code is not enough**: Even the cleanest code needs context. If a developer or user needs to know something to use your change, put it in the docs.

Always check the `docs/` folder for existing pages that might be affected by your contribution. If you're adding a completely new feature, create a new page in the appropriate category (Architecture, Guides, or Reference).

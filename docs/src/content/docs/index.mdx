description: The open-source, local-first operating system for the paiOS ecosystem
---

**paiOS** is the open-source, local-first operating system powering the **paiOS** ecosystem. It provides the software stack (Engine + OS) that enables paiOS hardware products to process voice, vision, context, and intelligence directly on trusted hardware, giving you full control over your data. Visit [aurintex.com](https://www.aurintex.com) for more information.

## The Vision

paiOS creates a bridge between powerful local hardware and your daily digital life. Our mission is to democratize access to hardware-accelerated AI while guaranteeing data sovereignty.

### paiBox (Current Focus)
**paiBox** is a plug-and-play Private AI Server based on the [Radxa Rock 5C](https://radxa.com/products/rock5/5c/) [SBC](/glossary/#s). It runs on your network and acts as a local AI backend for your existing tools.
*   **Local Inference:** Runs [sLLMs](/glossary/#s), [STT](/glossary/#s), embeddings, and other AI models entirely offline.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Works as a USB gadget or network device, compatible with any host OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **API-First:** Exposes OpenAI-compatible endpoints (similar to Ollama) for integration with tools like Obsidian, LibreOffice, or VS Code.
*   **Intelligent Input & Control:** Acts as a virtual keyboard/mouse ([HID](/glossary/#h)) to "type" text or execute commands directly into your PC, enabling seamless AI-driven interaction.

### paiScribe (Next)
**paiScribe** is a privacy-first meeting transcription device that works 100 percent offline. Records, transcribes, identifies speakers, and generates summaries: all on device, with no cloud dependency. Built for law firms, medical practices, government agencies, and anyone who needs meeting records without data leaving the room.

## Technology Stack

paiOS is built for performance, security, and reproducibility.

*   **Core Engine:** Built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for memory safety and low-latency hardware abstraction ([HAL](/glossary/#h)). The engine is **multi-platform**: it runs at least on **Linux desktop** for development and on target hardware (e.g. Rockchip [SBCs](/glossary/#s)) for deployment. See [Workspace and Build](/architecture/workspace-and-build/#platform-support) for the full platform support policy.
*   **Operating System:** Minimal, embedded Linux (Debian-based) built with [Debos](/architecture/adr/002-os-building-tool/) for reproducibility.
*   **Hardware:** Optimized for [NPU](/glossary/#n)-based [SBCs](/glossary/#s) (Single Board Computers), starting with the Radxa ecosystem. The engine is not limited to a single board; contributors are welcome to help support other platforms.

## Repository Structure

This monorepo contains the entire **paiOS** software stack:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`engine/`** | The **paiOS Engine**. The Rust-based neural orchestrator, handling [HAL](/glossary/#h), Security, and [IPC](/glossary/#i). |
| **`api/`** | Public API definitions ([gRPC](/glossary/#g), OpenAI-compat, Ollama-compat). |
| **`apps/`** | Modular extensions and reference implementations for the paiOS ecosystem. |
| **`os/`** | **paiOS** build configurations. Reproducible embedded Linux images. |
| **`docs/`** | This documentation site (built with Starlight). |

## Current Status

🚧 **Phase 0: Foundation & Architecture**

The project is currently executing the **"Great Pivot"**: transitioning from internal proof-of-concept to this clean, production-ready open-source architecture.

*   **Architecture:** Hexagonal Architecture (Rust) and modular [HAL](/glossary/#h)
*   **License:** See our [Licensing Guide](/guides/licensing/) for details.
*   **Focus:** Establishing the `pai-engine` and `paiOS` build pipeline.

## Get Involved

paiOS is an open-source project driven by the belief that AI should empower users with local-first intelligence and complete data sovereignty.

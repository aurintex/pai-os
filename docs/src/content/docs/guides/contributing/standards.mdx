To keep paiOS maintainable and high-quality, the project follows a set of core principles and standards. Whether you are using AI tools or writing code manually, these rules apply.

## Core Principles

The project values code that is easy to read, test, and maintain. These principles serve as a *compass*, not a set of rigid laws.

### The Pragmatic Mindset

-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering. Always choose the simplest solution.
-   **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**: Focus on the 20 percent of effort that provides 80 percent of the value.
-   **Pragmatic Utility**: Prioritize usefulness over code perfection. Ask: "Does this help the user?"
-   **Low-hanging Fruits First**: Start with quick wins that deliver immediate value.
-   **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: Use existing, proven solutions. Only build custom when necessary.
-   **Flexibility and Agility**: Stay adaptable. Avoid locking into rigid patterns too early.

### Quality Through Early Detection

-   **Shift Left**: Find and fix issues as early as possible in the development cycle.
-   **Rule of 10**: A bug found in development costs 1x, in testing 10x, in production 100x. Invest early.
-   **CI is the Safety Net**: Automated checks (fmt, clippy, tests) catch issues before they reach humans.

### Code Quality

-   **SOLID**: Ensure designs are flexible and robust.
-   **Clean Code**: Write code for humans first. Use descriptive names and small functions.
-   **Hexagonal Architecture**: Maintain clear boundaries between core, ports, and adapters (Engine, HAL, RPC). See [Architecture Documentation](/architecture/).


## Code Style

### General Rules
- Follow the rules defined in `.cursorrules`.
- Contributors must sign our CLA (one-time). See [CLA Guide](/guides/contributing/cla/).

### Rust Style
- Use `rustfmt` and `clippy` (zero warnings target).
- Documentation comments (`///` or `//!`) are required for all public and significant internal items.
- For stack vs heap, generics vs `Box<dyn Trait>`, and embedded-friendly choices, see [Rust Style and Best Practices](/guides/contributing/rust-style/).

## Definition of Done (DoD)

All changes must meet these requirements before they can be merged:

### 1. Correctness & Quality
- Code builds without errors (`cargo build`).
- All tests pass (`cargo test`).
- No clippy warnings.
- Solution follows KISS and Hexagonal Architecture principles.

### 2. Documentation
-   **User/Integration**: New features or API changes are documented in Starlight.
-   **Internal**: Complex logic is explained via Rust doc comments.
-   **Sync**: Documentation is regenerated and verified via `npm run build` in the `docs/` folder.
- See the [Documentation Guide](/guides/contributing/documentation/) for details.

### 3. Compliance
- CLA has been signed (first-time contributors).
- Dependencies are license-compliant (`cargo deny`).
- No sensitive data committed.

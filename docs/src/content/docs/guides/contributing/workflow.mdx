description: Step-by-step guide to contributing code to paiOS
---

This guide covers the technical steps for contributing to the project.

## 1. Preparation

Before you start, make sure you have the repository ready:

- **Contributors**: **Fork the repository** on GitHub ([pai-os](https://github.com/aurintex/pai-os)) and clone your fork locally.
- **Maintainers**: Clone the main repository directly.

## 2. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name like `feature/` or `bugfix/`.

```bash frame="none"
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## 3. Make Your Changes

Implement your changes following our [Development Standards](../standards/). Make sure to:
- Test your changes locally.
- Keep your commits logical (don't worry about perfection, as we squash anyway).

## 4. Commit with Sign-off

Every commit must include a DCO sign-off. The easiest way is to use the `-s` flag:

```bash frame="none"
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

### Conventional Commits (PR Titles)

To keep our changelogs automated and clean, we use the **Conventional Commits** format. However, we take a **pragmatic approach**:

- **Required for PR Titles**: The title of your Pull Request must follow the format (e.g., `feat: add HID support`). This is crucial because we **Squash & Merge**, and the PR title becomes the final commit message on the `main` branch.
- **Optional for Local Commits**: While working on your branch, you don't need to strictly follow the format for every small commit. Use what makes you productive.

**Common Types:**
- **`feat:`**: A new feature.
- **`fix:`**: A bug fix.
- **`docs:`**: Documentation changes.
- **`refactor:`**: Code changes that don't add features or fix bugs.
- **`chore:`**: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build scripts).

See the [DCO Guide](../dco/) for more ways to sign your commits.

## 5. AI-Assisted Development

If you are using AI tools like Cursor or TaskMasterAI, please refer to our **[AI-Assisted Development Guide](../ai-workflow/)** for a recommended workflow that maximizes efficiency while maintaining quality.

## 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

Push your branch to GitHub:

```bash frame="none"
# Contributors push to their fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Maintainers push to the main repository
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

After pushing, go to the GitHub repository and create a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `main` branch.

## 6. Review and Merge

1.  **CI/CD**: Wait for all automated checks to pass (Build, Lint, Tests, DCO).
2.  **Approval**:
    - **Contributors**: Wait for a maintainer to review and approve your PR.
    - **Maintainers**: Request a review from another maintainer. **Self-merging without approval is discouraged** except for trivial fixes.
3.  **Merge**: Once approved, the PR will be merged using **Squash and merge**.

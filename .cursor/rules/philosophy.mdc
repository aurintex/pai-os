# paiOS Development Philosophy

**This rule ensures all AI assistants (Cursor, Antigravity, etc.) follow the paiOS pragmatic mindset.**

## Core Philosophy

You are working on **paiOS** – we value **working software over perfect code**.

### The Pragmatic Mindset
- **Pareto (80/20)**: Focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of the value.
- **Low Hanging Fruits**: Start with quick wins. Deliver value early.
- **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: Use existing solutions. Only build custom when truly necessary.
- **Flexibility & Agility**: Stay adaptable. Avoid over-engineering early.
- **KISS**: Simplest solution wins.

### Quality Through Early Detection
- **Shift Left**: Find issues early. Prevention > Detection > Correction.
- **Rule of 10**: A bug in dev costs 1x, in test 10x, in prod 100x. Invest early.
- **CI is the Safety Net**: Automated checks catch issues before humans review.

### Pragmatic Problem Solving
- **Usability > Perfection**: Code that works and helps users beats "perfect" code that ships late.
- **Solve real problems**: Ask "Does this actually help the user?" before every decision.
- **Don't die in perfection**: Good enough today beats perfect never.

## Applying This Philosophy

When working on any task:

1. **Before starting**: What's the quick win? What's the 80/20?
2. **During work**: Am I over-engineering? Is there an existing solution?
3. **Before finishing**: Does this actually solve the user's problem?

## AI Assistant Instructions

**When in doubt, be pragmatic:**
- Recommend the simpler solution
- Suggest existing tools/libraries before custom implementations
- Point out when something might be over-engineered
- Prioritize shipping working features over theoretical perfection

title: Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
description: Why and how we use DCO for license compliance
---

paiOS uses the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** to ensure that all contributions are properly licensed.

## Why DCO?

Instead of a complex legal agreement (CLA), we use the DCO because:
- **It is easy**: No legal review or paperwork is needed.
- **It is a standard**: Used by major projects like the **Linux kernel** and **Git**.
- **Transparency**: It maintains clear ownership while keeping the contribution process fast.

## How to Sign Off

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message. By adding this line, you certify that you have the right to submit the work under the project's license.

### Format
```text frame="none"
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

## Setup Methods

### 1. IDE Setup (Recommended & Easiest Way)

**VS Code / Cursor:**

1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for: `git.alwaysSignOff`
3. Enable the checkbox

This automatically adds the sign-off to all your commits. For more information, see the [official VS Code Git documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).

### 2. CLI Method

For terminal users, use the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash frame="none"
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

**Optional:** Create a Git alias to make this easier:

```bash frame="none"
git config alias.cs 'commit -s'
```

Then you can use `git cs` instead of `git commit -s` for signed commits.

## DCO Enforcement

- **DCO Bot Active**: We have enabled the DCO bot to automatically verify that every commit in a Pull Request includes a valid sign-off. PRs with unsigned commits will be blocked from merging.
- **No Exceptions**: All commits, including documentation-only changes, require a sign-off. If a PR has unsigned commits, they must be amended before it can be merged.

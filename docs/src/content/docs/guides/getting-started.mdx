description: Set up your development environment for paiOS
---

Welcome! This guide will help you set up your development environment for **paiOS**.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Edition 2021 (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Node.js**: For building documentation (v18 or later)
- **Docker**: For building OS images (optional, for OS development)
- **Git**: For version control

## Build Tooling

Depending on what you want to build, we provide different toolchains:

### Local Rust (Core Development)
If you are contributing to the **paiOS Engine** or the **OS Recipes**, you should set up Rust locally as described above.

### Dockerized Toolchain (App Development)
For 3rd party app developers, we provide the **`pai-builder`** Docker image. This image encapsulates the entire cross-compilation toolchain and system headers (sysroot).
- **No manual SDK installation**: Just run your build command inside the container.
- **Reproducible**: Ensures your app builds the same way as in our CI/CD.

```bash frame="none"
# Example: Build an app using the builder container
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  pai/pai-builder:latest \
  cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

## Quick Start (Local Engine)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash frame="none"
   git clone https://github.com/aurintex/pai-os.git
   cd pai-os
   ```

2. **Set up the engine:**
   ```bash frame="none"
   cd engine
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Set up the documentation:**
   ```bash frame="none"
   cd docs
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended):**
   To ensure your code always follows our standards, install the pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash frame="none"
   # We use basic hooks for formatting and linting
   # Make sure you have rustfmt and clippy installed
   ```

5. **Configure Git for automatic DCO sign-off** (see [DCO Guide](/guides/contributing/dco/#1-auto-sign-recommended) for details):
   ```bash frame="none"
   git config format.signoff true
   ```

## Next Steps

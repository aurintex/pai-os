# Definition of Done (DoD) Enforcer

**Single Source of Truth:** All changes must comply with the Definition of Done (DoD) defined in [Development Standards (standards.mdx)](mdc:docs/src/content/docs/guides/contributing/standards.mdx).

## Required Action
Before declaring any task as "finished" or "done", you MUST:

1.  **Read the DoD Section**: Open and review the "Definition of Done" section in `docs/src/content/docs/guides/contributing/standards.mdx`.
2.  **Verify Every Point**: Go through each requirement (Functional, Quality, Documentation, Compliance) as defined there.
3.  **Documentation Sync Check**: If the Rust API was touched, ensure `npm run build` was executed in the `docs/` directory.

## Final Statement Requirement
In your final response to the user, you MUST explicitly state:
> "I have verified this task against the official **Definition of Done** in `standards.mdx`. Specifically, I checked: [List 2-3 key points relevant to this specific task, e.g., 'API Sync' or 'CLA Signed']."
